1. In table 2.2, in confusion matrix on the right, what does "same marginals but independent rows and columns" means?

2. In the case of classification where we are interested in predicting the class which is a minortiy in the dataset, what can we 
realistically do to have a better representation of / more examples of the minority class to train the classifier?

3. I did not understand the concept of a coverage plot at all. An example worked through in class would be helpful. (From "Visualizing classification performance" in chapter 2")
